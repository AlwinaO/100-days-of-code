# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 7, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Sinatra Final Project - Used tux to check seeded data, build (and mount) UsersController and build login view.

**Thoughts**: I'm still learning how to use tux as it's helpful to make sure I seeded the database correctly but more importantly that the tables are set up properly when I add additional data and the models have the right associations. I also started building the users controller and set up RESTful routing for the login and signyp routes, as well as, build the login view. I checked everthing in the browser to make sure the routes are hitting the next in the controller. This mostly makes sense but sometimes I get confused with which verb/action to write. Work in progress...
